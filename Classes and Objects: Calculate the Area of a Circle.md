# Classes and Objects in Python: Calculate the Area of a Circle

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the *area of a circle* based on the radius provided by the user. This program uses a class named cse and a method mech to perform the calculation.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. *Get user input*: Take the radius of the circle as input from the user.
2. *Define the class*: Create a class named cse.
3. *Define the method*: Inside the class, define the method mech to calculate the area of the circle using the formula:  
   Area = pi *r^2 
4. *Execute the program*: Create an object of the class and call the method with the radius value.

## ðŸ§¾ Program

```
import math
class cse:
    def mech(self, radius):
        area = math.pi * radius ** 2
        return area
circle = cse()
try:
    r = float(input("Enter the radius of the circle: "))
    result = circle.mech(r)
    print(f"The area of the circle with radius {r} is {result:.2f}")
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid number for radius.")

```

## Output
![442481565-2375c626-8d14-4f5a-91a9-ca135db1596d](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8d7367c-2beb-4d74-84e0-90eb671e82cc)

## Result
Thus,the program has been executedÂ successfully.
