# File Handling in Python: Count Lines Not Starting with 'T'

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that counts the number of lines in a text file story.txt that do *not* start with the alphabet 'T'.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Open the file story.txt in *read mode*.
2. Initialize a counter count to zero.
3. Iterate through each line of the file:
   - Check if the first character of the line is *not* 'T'.
   - If the line does not start with 'T', increment the count by 1.
4. After processing all lines, print the count value, which represents the number of lines that do not start with 'T'.

## 🧾 Program
```
def count_non_T_lines(filename):
    count = 0
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            for line in file:
                if not line.lstrip().startswith('T'):
                    count += 1
        print(f"Number of lines not starting with 'T': {count}")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f" File '{filename}' not found.")
count_non_T_lines("story.txt")
```
## Output
![442482348-533398cd-8873-48fe-8ce1-b341b9aec84f](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f215bb05-22a0-45e5-96a4-12c81f2c8901)

## Result
Thus the program has been executed successfully.
